<h1>K-Means Algorithm Implementation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm in Java, applied to the Iris dataset. The project demonstrates how to partition data into clusters based on feature similarity.</p>
<p>K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. This implementation applies the K-Means algorithm to the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning that includes measurements of iris flowers from three different species.</p>
